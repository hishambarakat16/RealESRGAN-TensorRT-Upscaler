# RealESRGAN-TensorRT-Upscaler
This project provides a high-performance image and video upscaler using [RealESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN), accelerated with NVIDIA TensorRT. It supports both 2x and 4x upscaling, and allows you to specify output height and width. Instructions are included for image and video upscaling using the converted models.
